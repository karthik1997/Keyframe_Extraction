# Keyframe_Extraction
## A simple Keyframe Extraction model using Katna

Keyframe is one type of video abstraction technique for visual indexing. It is defined as a subset of a video
sequence that can represent the video visual content as closely as possible. The keyframe can be a good visual index
because its organization allows for easy browsing and navigating.
If we search for particular video in any search engine for ex. Google server it will give lakhs of results within few seconds
which may not be of our interest so this problem can be solved by using key frame extraction. Hence Key frame
extraction is one of the important research issues in the field of video information retrieval.

Katna is open source tool that automates the boring, error prone task of videos key/best frames extraction. The extracted frames are the most accurate and compact summary of the video content. Katna video module has been written in python 3 and has been successfully tested on mp4,.mov and .avi video formats. Technically, it should work well with other video formats since we have used openCV VideoCapture function. Katna has been written in an API style so that developers with no computer vision experience can use it as well.
