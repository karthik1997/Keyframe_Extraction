# Keyframe_Extraction
A simple Keyframe Extraction model using Katna

Katna is open source tool that automates the boring, error prone task of videos key/best frames extraction. The extracted frames are the most accurate and compact summary of the video content. Katna video module has been written in python 3 and has been successfully tested on mp4,.mov and .avi video formats. Technically, it should work well with other video formats since we have used openCV VideoCapture function. Katna has been written in an API style so that developers with no computer vision experience can use it as well.
